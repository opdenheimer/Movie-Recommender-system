# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system built using Python. This project recommends movies based on similarity with the selected movie, using cosine similarity on textual features like genres, keywords, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- Recommend similar movies based on title input
- Uses cosine similarity for content-based filtering
- Clean and interactive user interface (optional: Streamlit or CLI)
- Efficient handling of large datasets
- Easy to extend with collaborative filtering or hybrid methods

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Dataset includes movie titles, overviews, genres, keywords, etc.
   - All features are combined into a single text-based feature.
   - Text is vectorized using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF.

2. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - Cosine similarity matrix is created from vectorized features.
   - Given a movie, the system fetches the top N most similar movies.

3. **Recommendation**:
   - Based on user input, top similar movies are displayed.
